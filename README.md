# SmartFarm
SmartFarm is an application developed to detect diseases in rice using leaf analysis.

In developing this SmartFarm, we use [Tensorflow Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and use a transfer learning system with the [Resnet50](https://hard.io/api/applications/resnet/#resnet50-function)

## Documentation
  1. Download the Dataset, the process are on the notebook
  2. Create the training and validation batch 
  3. Create the label 
  4. Training the model
  5. Validating the model
  6. Use the converter to convert the keras model into the .h5 model
  7. Deploy the model to android using tflite
