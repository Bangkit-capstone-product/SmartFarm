# SmartFarm

SmartFarm : SmartFarm GitHub Repositories of Bangkit Academy 2022 Capstone Project from 3 learning path. Machine Learning, Mobile development, Cloud Computing from team C22-PX442.

# About The Project
Our concern for rice farmers in Indonesia who often suffer heavy losses due to crop failures made our team take up this project. Most of the rice farmers who experience crop failure are caused by diseases in rice

smartfarm can detect disease in rice through leaf analysis. the data will be analyzed by a machine learning models from cloud to predict the diseases that exist in rice. smartfarm helps rice farmers to identify and prevent disease early on.
