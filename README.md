# SmartFarm
in this smartfarm application, we use realtime firebase (https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/smartfarm-352301/overview) as the database and for the  authentication.

## Firebase
Firebase is a database tool from Google that we can use to help developers develop their applications. It is also a BaaS (Backend as a Service), which can speed up the work of developers so they can focus on developing applications without great effort on the back-end .
The Firebase Realtime Database is a database hosted via the cloud. Your data will be stored and executed in JSON form and synchronized in real time to each connected user. This makes it easier for you to manage a database on a large scale.
